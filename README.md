### Some Parallax Responsive Templates for Beta Website of KTJ

> There are **5** folders, each of which consists of a template. All of them have some cool features that can be implemented into our Beta Website. Just **cloning** the repository and **opening the index.html files** of each folder will open the websites.

### Cloning : 

> - To clone the Git repository into you PC, ***go to the desired location***, eg D:/    
> - Run this command on your gitbash or Command line      
```git config --global http.proxy http://172.16.2.30:8080```
> - Then run        
```git clone <copy address from Repository>```
> - Now ***whenever you start working on the project, configure proxy*** using       
```git config --global http.proxy http://172.16.2.30:8080``` 
> - To Pull (i.e. get the latest Code on local system )       
```git pull```
> - After making changes, to ***see which files have been changed*** and status of those files, run       
```git status```
> - To stage files for commit, run        
```git add . ```
> - To commit changes, run         
```git commit -m "A commit message will be here which will help in identifying the change"```
> - Finally to push (i.e. to ***upload your latest changes to github***), run          
```git push -u origin master```
