## Some Parallax Responsive Templates for Beta Website of KTJ

> There are **5** folders, each of which consists of a template. All of them have some cool features that can be implemented into our Beta Website. Just **cloning** the repository and **opening the index.html files** of each folder will open the websites.

## Cloning : 

- To clone the Git repository into you PC, ***go to the desired location***, eg D:/    
- Run this command on your gitbash or Command line      
	
	git config --global http.proxy http://172.16.2.30:8080
- Then run        

	git clone <copy address from Repository>
4)Now ***whenever you start working on the project, configure proxy*** using       
	
	git config --global http.proxy http://172.16.2.30:8080 
5)To Pull (i.e. get the latest Code on local system )       

	git pull
6)After making changes, to ***see which files have been changed*** and status of those files, run       
	
	git status
7)To stage files for commit, run        

	git add .
8)To commit changes, run         

	git commit -m "A commit message will be here which will help in identifying the change"
9)Finally to push (i.e. to ***upload your latest changes to github***), run          

	git push -u origin master
